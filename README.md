# Taylor-Swift-Textacular-Analysis
The research data was obtained from various visualizations created by Python to analyze Taylor Swift’s writing style. The data revolves around her songs’ word counts, word lengths, and sentiment tones to make quantitative and qualitative conclusions about why her career has been so successful. The songs chosen for analysis encompass the entire span of Swift’s career to emphasize any trends or discrepancies within her compositions over time. The files we used for this mini project contain song lyrics from a tune from each of Taylor Swift’s ten albums. The world throughout the times when these albums were made, along with Swift’s emotions, fluctuated a lot. These variations contributed to the distinctive moods that each album provides.
